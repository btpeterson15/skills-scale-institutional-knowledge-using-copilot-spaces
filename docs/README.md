# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation! This README provides an at-a-glance summary of our project management lifecycle and links to all detailed process docs used across projects at OctoAcme.

## Project Management Process Summary

OctoAcme delivers projects using a clear, repeatable set of processes:

- **Initiation:** Define what problem needs solving, engage stakeholders, and map success criteria.
- **Planning:** Create actionable backlogs, agree on milestones, clarify risks and dependencies.
- **Execution & Tracking:** Use project boards, standups, and workflows for daily management and progress tracking.
- **Risk Management & Communication:** Maintain a risk register, communicate status, escalate blockers efficiently.
- **Release & Deployment:** Standardized pre-release checks, deployment steps, and incident/rollback playbooks.
- **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement:** Capture learnings, review action items, and drive process improvements.
